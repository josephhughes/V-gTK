Introduction
===============

The Virus Genome Toolkit (V-gTK) is a software framework for end-to-end management of viral genomes, covering curation, annotation, and structured organization. Built with reproducibility and shareability at its core, V-gTK enables researchers to transform raw sequence data into well-structured, biologically meaningful resources.
With the rapid growth of viral sequencing, researchers face the challenge of turning raw data into interpretable biological insights. V-gTK addresses this by providing tools to:
Standardize and curate viral genome data using transparent, version-controlled processes.
Annotate and organize sequences with reference alignments, gene features, and mutation data.
Integrate and track provenance of metadata from GenBank, capturing both major and minor updates to maintain an up-to-date, ready-to-use database resource.
Enable reproducible analyses through standardized input formats and modular workflows.
V-gTK is closely integrated with the Virus Genome Database (V-gDB), which supports the creation of searchable, extensible databases linking sequences to curated mutation data, phylogenies, and metadata. Together, V-gTK and V-gDB provide a flexible ecosystem for deep virus analysis, serving as both analytical platforms and knowledge repositories.
This documentation will guide you through installation, configuration, and usage of V-gTK, illustrating its application with case studies such as influenza A virus and rabies virus.
